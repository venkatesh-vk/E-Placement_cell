## Technologies Used

The E-Placement Cell system is built using several technologies and Python libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the backend and data processing.

- **tkinter**: tkinter is used to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) for student profiles and placement management.

- **Pandas**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and CSV file handling.

- **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is employed for database operations, ensuring data integrity and security.

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: For sending emails to company HRs.

- **Jinja2**: Jinja2 is used for HTML templating in the GUI.

- **WTForms**: WTForms is used for form validation and rendering in the GUI.
